# Hourly
**Note**: This is an endeavour to learn Ruby and Rails.

**Hourly** aims to be something like **Twitter**, but all posts ('tweets')
expire after one hour.

After an messages has been posted and one hour has passed, it cannot be 
interacted with or viewed anymore, although the owners can still view 
those.

## Rails
This project aims to cover the basics of using **Ruby on Rails** and more, 
some notable used stuff are:
- Basic Rails: MVC design and CRUD operations (messages).
- DB usage ([sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)) with migrations.
- User accounts (via [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)).

The project also has Bootstrap included, but the design is lacking.

## TODO
Stuff that could be improved or needs to be added:
- Better website design
- Add comments to messages
- Search ability
- Follows and notifications system.
